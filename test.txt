Listening Skills

I learned...

This workshop focused on the elements of being a good listener, and how listening skills effect
your comprehension of topics and your relationships. One fact that I found stunning was that
people really on hear 25-50% of everything we physically “hear”. This is why we should all
practice active listening, which is the conscious effort to hear and understand what someone is
saying. This helps eliminate some of the bad habits people have when conversing like assuming
they know an answer ahead of time, always trying to be helpful, treating a conversation as a
competition, trying to impress others, and even paying too much attention to details rather than
the point of the conversation. Things we can do to be more active and mindful listeners include
paying attention, giving visual cues that we are listening, providing structured feedback,
avoiding interrupting the speaker, and responding appropriately.

My story connected to this workshop is...

| pride myself on being a good listener, and | do believe that J exhibit many of these traits when
conversing with someone. However, watching my mother interact with my father, my friends, or
her colleagues makes it obvious that she is a far superior listener. She does exactly what this
seminar says an active listener must do. She nods occasionally to show she’s listening, keeps her
comments to a minimum, but when she does interrupt it is helpful but not overbearing, and she
never assumes to know the conclusion of the conversation. While we went through all the
aspects of active listening I could attribute them very easily to my mother, which was really very
interesting for me.

I plan to...

| certainly plan to be more mindful of the impression I give to people who are expecting me to
listen to them, especially as far as physical cues go. Everyone knows the feeling of speaking to
someone who clearly is not interested, and J hope to never accidentally give that impression.
This seminar points out obvious things that many people simply forget about, or have never
thought deeply about. and by exposing students to the fact that these small things do matter |
believe it will make me and the other participants far more conscious of being an active listener.
