# Project::SCRIBE

### Installation
Unfortunately, as of right now, installation is a bit of an involved process.

First, download
this repo. There are two main methods for this: downloading a zipped file and
cloning. To download this project as a zipped file, press the green "Code"
button and then "Download ZIP." You should then extract the files by opening the
zipped file and place them somewhere you can remember, like on your desktop. If
you choose to clone this repo instead, you need to install git for your command
line, then run the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/ocr-senior-project/ocr.git`

Next, you need to make sure you have Python installed. Because Python 3.9 was
released very recently, it might not have some things we need, so please install
Python 3.8. Head to the [Python website](https://www.python.org), go to
"Downloads," then scroll down and select the latest version of Python 3.8 (this
should be 3.8.6). Scroll down to the "Files" section, and download and run the
64-bit installer for your operating system.

Finally, you will need to install some packages. Currently, we only have an
executable for MacOS, but the command is relatively simple. If you're using
MacOS, just double click the "SCRIBE" file; it should update or install all the
packages we need and launch the app. If you're on Windows, you can right click
the "install.py" file and choose to open it with Python; this should install all
the packages you need. Linux users will need to navigate to the directory with
the command line and run the following command: `python install.py`
